Gedafe Examples
---------------

This directory contains an example application for Gedafe.

It's a very simple ordering system with products, 
customers and orders.

demo1.sql contains the PostgreSQL command to create the database. You have to
first create a database called 'demo1' and then execute:

  psql -U postgres -f demo1.sql demo1

demo1.cgi is the Gedafe startup script for this application. Note that you have
to adjust the paths in demo1.cgi to match up with the place you have installed
Gedafe.

Example templates are also included (in the 'templates' directory).
These are usable for any application.

The 'images' directory contains the images that are references in the
example templates. Install them so that they can be accessed under the
URL '/images' (if you want them in another place just change the
templates).
