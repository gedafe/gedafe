          #### Gedafe (the Generic Database Frontend) 1.0.0 ####


Introduction
------------

    Gedafe (the Generic Datbase Frontend) is an appliction independant
    web frontend for databases. This means that the frontend doesn't
    contain any information about what structure and contens of the
    database.

    The idea is to put all the application logic into the database,
    along with meta-information on how to present the data and then to
    use a generic frontend that gathers this information and uses it
    to build the user interface. This aproach greatly reduces
    developement time since you only have to develop the application
    at the database level and the web frontend comes for free.

    And there is more:
  
    * Gedafe also uses a flexible templating system. It allows you
      customize the look of the user interface to large degree.

    * Gedafe generated interfaces also supports "deep linking" this
      means that you can bookmark every page as it is presented.

    * At the moment Gedafe works only with PostgreSQL. But the
      structure of the application does not depend on PostgresSQL.

    * Gedafe is *NOT* yet another database-administration frontend
      with table editing ability. It is a real user interface.


Release Notes
-------------

    This is the first public version. The program has been used
    internally in production for several months already.
