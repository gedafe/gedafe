            ============================================
            Gedafe (the Generic Database Frontend) 1.4.0
            ============================================



Introduction
------------

    Gedafe (Generic Database Front-End) is an application independent
    end-user web front-end for databases. Application independant means,
    that the front-end doesn't have any information about the structure
    and contents of the database.

    The idea behind Gedafe is to put all the application logic into the
    database, along with meta-information on how to present the data.
    The front-end then gathers this information and uses it to build the
    user interface. This approach greatly reduces development time since
    you only have to develop the application at the database level and
    the web front-end comes for free.

    And there is more:
  
    * Gedafe uses a flexible templating system. It allows you
      customize the look of the user interface to a large degree.

    * Gedafe generated interfaces support "deep linking". This
      means that you can bookmark every page as it is presented.

    * At the moment Gedafe works only with PostgreSQL. But the
      structure of the application does not depend on PostgreSQL.

    * Gedafe is *NOT* yet another database-administration front-end
      with table editing ability. It is a real user interface.

Release Notes
-------------

  * Support for PostgreSQL >= 8.1

  * Dropped support for PostgreSQL <= 7.2

  * Support for schemas
 
  * Bugfix: Gedafe Pearls didn't work with Konqueror and Safari.

  * Much improved search functionality. It is now possible to search on
    multiple fields, on all fields at once and using special operators

  * New widget: format_number, format_date, format_timestamp.
    Just like normal text fields, but the values get converted with
    PostgreSQL's to_char/to_number/to_timestamp/to_date formatting
    functions.

  * New widget: file2fs lets you upload files which endup in a local
    directory.

  * New widget: mncombo for representing mn-relationships.

  * New widget: radio - like idcombo but with radio buttons.

  * Two column layout for Entry Page.

  * "Print format" link to show all records on one page.

  * Added 'clone' button to create a new record based on an old one.

  * New meta_tables attribute "edit_show_id" to allow editing of the
    primary key id in the edit mask.

  * New meta_tables attribute "editmask" to specify a custom edit
    template for a table.

  * New meta_tables attribute "longcomment" to specify a description for
    a table.

  * New meta tables attribute "twocol" for two-columns edit forms.

  * New configuration variable "edit_buttons_left" to put the
    edit/clone/delete buttons on the left.

  * New meta field on list tables: "meta_bgcolour" for setting
    different background colors for each line in a list view.

  * Automatically add links to referenced records in columns of a
    list view (showref).

  * Added "quicklinks": user-defined links put at the bottom of 
    list views. See doc/gedafe-sql.pod
