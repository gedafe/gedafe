        Upgrading Gedafe to a new version
        =================================

(arrows indicate actions that you should make when upgrading)

1.0.1
-----

* The old pre-0.9.16 meta_tables and meta_fields structure is not anymore
  supported.

* New template: error.html used for unexpected internal errors.

  -> put the new error.html in your templates directories

* The escaping characted for encoding data in reedit_data has changed
  from '%' to '!', so any old pre-built urls with reedit_data set won't work.

* searches are now case insensitive
