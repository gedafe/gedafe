Bugs
----
- Database errors sometimes do not get printed

- if meta_sort in views is not sorted and it sorts on one column which is not
  unique the order of the elements might change while scrolling pages. this is
  because postgresql doesn't ensure that unsorted records come always in the
  same order. Maybe we should order with obj_id or something, so that it is
  always the same, it is strange for users...
