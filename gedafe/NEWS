        News and upgrading information for Gedafe
        =========================================

(arrows indicate actions that you should make when upgrading)
------------------------------------------------------------------
HEAD    (2004-04-13)

   *    Enhance the refcol feature: Make the referencing column
	configurable. Needed for circular or multiple references.
   *    Added forgotten schema1.sql from enhanced schema support
		Johannes     
------------------------------------------------------------------
HEAD    (2004-04-08)
	
   *	enhanced schema support
	If you add more then one schema to your gedafe application, 
	the top of the Entry screen shows links into the other schemas 
	instead of table links. So you only need one cgi script.
	Addedd example/templates/header3.html
  *	persistency cleanup
	Make the code faster/work/work by using the fact that $g is 
	only loaded once, if you use the "speedy" perl interpreter
		Johannes

------------------------------------------------------------------
HEAD    (2004-03-31)

	* Added quicklinks

	   quicklinks are user-defined links put at the bottom of 
	   list views. See doc/gedafe-sql.pod

	* fixed an error in example/demo1.sql to make the editmask
	  example work.
		Johannes
------------------------------------------------------------------
HEAD    (2004-03-30)
	Javascript protection enabled on all tables.
	See gedafe-javascript.pod for details.
	------------
	Here are some more descriptions for people browsing
	through this file with a text search utility:
	script broken
	script error
	script missing
	script removed
------------------------------------------------------------------
HEAD    (2004-03-22)
	You can now supply a hand-crafted edit mask template

	This makes it possible to make edit masks more user friendly, 
	to use Java Script for input control, etc.
	A very ugly example "customer" template is supplied for the 
	"customer" table.
		Johannes
------------------------------------------------------------------
HEAD    (2004-03-19)
	You can move the Edit/Clone/Delete buttons in the list
	view to the left. Supply the new parameter edit_buttons_left
	and set it to 1 in the Start() function
		Johannes
------------------------------------------------------------------
HEAD    (2004-03-12)
	Long comments 
	Long comments can be saved per table in meta_tables. This
	is displayed in the entry screen but also in tooltips
	and table headers.
	Added id colums to meta_fields and meta_tables. This makes
	it possible to edit them in phpPgmyadmin, and to add more
	then one attribute to a table(+field). 
	To make it bullet proof, one should add a 
	UNIQUE (meta_tables_table,meta_tables_attribute) constraint 
	to meta_tables and a similar constraint on meta_fields:
        UNIQUE (meta_fields_table,meta_fields_field,meta_fields_attribute)

	Tested including the changed demo1.sql script

------------------------------------------------------------------
HEAD    (2004-03-10)
	Checked in agreed upon fix to schema code with 
	robust defaults for schema and schema search path
	Still work to to....
			Johannes
------------------------------------------------------------------
HEAD    (2004-03-09)
	Fixed minor warnings in DB.pm and GUI.pm 
			Johannes
------------------------------------------------------------------
HEAD    (2004-03-05) 
	fix schema code when no schema is defined
			author: dws
	Re-Tested by Johannes
------------------------------------------------------------------
HEAD    (2004-03-01)

* Fixed schema support: Add default value for "schema" config value.
	Patch waiting for Freek Zindels Comments.

------------------------------------------------------------------
HEAD	(2004-02-16)

  * The documentation on navigational aids has finally been written.
    It's the showref and 'columnname eq ref => link' stuff in 
    gedafe-sql.pod (freek) 

  * Oysters is a new plugin mechanism that works like Pearls but focusses
    on the dialogue with a user. In this dialogue you no longer need to
    worry about double forms, maintaining input and other html
    related troubles. It's not strictly 'application in the database'
    but there is stuff that a database won't do for you.(freek)

    -> Oysters save their state to the gedafe-daemon. This is a new
       Feature for the daemon.
       Replace your existing daemon with the new one. 

  * Files in bytea columns can now have funny characters, like spaces
    When vieuwing these files with older versions of gedafe
    you will see the escaped problem characters. (freek)

------------------------------------------------------------------
HEAD    (2004-02-13)

* Added widget radio button

  MODIFIED FILES:
	/usr/cvs/gedafe/gedafe/doc/gedafe-sql.pod,v
	/usr/cvs/gedafe/gedafe/lib/perl/Gedafe/GUI.pm,v
 (Johannes)
------------------------------------------------------------------
HEAD    (2004-02-12)
* Made 2 column edit/add layout configurable

  The meta tables attribute "twocol" is used to control
  one vs two column layout of a table. documentation included
	(Johannes)
  MODIFIED FILES:
        doc/gedafe-sql.pod example/templates/editfield.html
        lib/perl/Gedafe/GUI.pm

------------------------------------------------------------------
HEAD    (2004-02-11)
  * Add draft documentation to the "showref" attribute in meta_tables.
	(Johannes)
------------------------------------------------------------------
HEAD    (2004-02-11)
  * Added schema support. See gedafe-user.pod. Should work with
    postgres < 7.3 also. Changes to:
    NEWS doc/gedafe-sql.pod doc/gedafe-user.pod example/demo1.cgi
    lib/perl/Gedafe/DB.pm lib/perl/Gedafe/Start.pm
    	(Johannes)
------------------------------------------------------------------
HEAD    (2004-02-09)
  * forgot a #endif in example example/templates/header.html
------------------------------------------------------------------
HEAD    (2004-02-09
  * New Button to toggle "Print format" and "screen format". Print format
    means to print all records in one browser window. This is handy to
    print out data or Reports. Also it is nice for the use of Excel Weblinks
    Changes to example/templates/header.html and lib/perl/Gedafe/GUI.pm
	(Johannes)
------------------------------------------------------------------
HEAD    (2004-02-04)
  * Change DB.pm, so that numeric fields accept separator or grouping
    characters in numbers and decimal comma instead of the decimal 
    point. This is a hack as it should be done in the widget code.
	(Johannes)

HEAD	(2004-01-20) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Allow column names not starting with the table name.
    (documentation change in doc/gedafe-sql.pod (johannes)

HEAD	(2003-12-12)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * offer a button to copy a record "as new" i.e. "clone" a record. 	
    Change template td_edit.html, GUI.pm, add th_clone.html and
    "clone.gif" Button (johannes)

  * Support for user plugin widgets as per Widgets.pm
    Works just like the pearls. (freek)

  * Add id columms to meta_fields and meta_tables in example database
    demo.sql. This is not needed, but it allows you to maintain these
    tables more easy with tools like phpPgAmin or pgadmin3 (johannes)

1.2.1 (2003-09-03)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * New widget: combo (just the combo-box without text entry)

  * Bugfixes: date widget didn't work.

1.2.0 (2003-09-27)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * PearlReports have been integrated with gedafe. It is now possible
    to write perl modules (pearls) which will be picked up by gedafe
    and presented in the "Entry" screen. The idea is to use this
    facility for generating complex, structured (multi-level) reports.
    Pearls have access to gedafes Webform generator as well a to the
    database handle.

  * Combo-boxes must always reference the 'id' of the table and not the
    'hid' if the table has one. The old behaviour was confusing and was
    thus changed, but you can still tell Gedafe to behave like that
    by setting 'gedafe_compat' to '1.0' in the Start function.

    -> Change all combo-boxes where the 'hid' is referenced in the
       'id' field of the view to reference the 'id' of the table

    OR

    -> Put the following in the Start function of the cgi script:

         gedafe_compat => '1.0'

  * The 'filterfirst' attribute must now be set on the _list view if one
    is used.

    -> Change the meta_table_table field of all filterfirst attributes to
       the name of the _list view instead of the table, if a list view is
       present.
    -> Since attributes in a _list view have no reference property, this must be
       specified in meta_fields (check the docs)

  * More widgets: the 'widget' attribute of the meta_fields
    can now specify more widgets and widgets can now have parameters. For
    example with 'idcombo(combo=...)' another combo-box can be selected
    instead of the one chosen by Gedafe. See 'EDIT WIDGETS' in
    gedafe-sql.pod for a description of all widgets.

  * Blobs (files) can now be inserted into bytea columns if you have
    Postgresql >= 7.2

  * Referencing large tables can now be done trough a java
    applet instead of a html select widget. This makes large (>100 rows or
    a few kb) tables more easy to use. See documentation about 'isearch'
    for details.
    Please remember to set the 'isearch' value to point to your copy of
    isearch.jar in your cgi script. It must be a relative address on the 
    same server as the cgi script for java security reasons.

  * Dates can now be entered with a special 'date' widget.

  * Data can now be scanned for tokens resembling web objects (e.g.
    e-mail addresses, http urls), and automatically marked up to be hyper
    links. Set the 'markup' attribute to 1 in meta_fields for the desired
    column.
  
  * Gedafe can now count the total number of results returned from the
    database.  This is helpful for seeing the number of items found by a
    search, and in skipping to the beginning end or of a result set.
    When enabled, you will see extra navigation links "First", and "Last"
    on every page, as well as the index of the rows shown in relation to
    total rows.  To enable this feature, call Start() with the
      'show_row_count' => 1,
    parameter.  It is turned off by default due to slightly higher
    database overhead.
  
  * If you have the Text::CSV_XS Perl module installed (available from CPAN),
    gedafe automatically detects it, and gives the option of exporting data
    either in CSV format (comma-separated-values), or in tab-delimited format.
    CSV format is useful for data with embedded newlines characters.

  * The meta_fields attribute 'align' can be used to change the alignment
    of a coulumn. The default is right-aligned for numeric fields and
    left-aligned otherwise.

  * The buttons in the list view (with the arrows for navigation and 'ADD' to
    add a new record) can now also appear at the top before the list. Use the
    'list_buttons' option in the Start function to select where to display the
    buttons. The value can be one of: top, bottom, both or none.

1.0.6 (2002-03-17)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * 'action=export' instead of 'action=list' or 'action=listrep' returns
    a comma-separated-values listing of all rows of the table. You can use
    the EXPORT_URL variable in the templates to reference the correct
    URL.

1.0.5 (2002-02-18)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * The edit view now returns to the "Referer" if it is provided by the browser.
    This makes it possible to jump internally directly to an edit view (from
    the list view of another table for example)

1.0.1 (2001-02-20)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * The old pre-0.9.16 meta_tables and meta_fields structure is not anymore
    supported.
  
  * New template: error.html used for unexpected internal errors.
  
    -> put the new error.html in your templates directories
  
  * The escaping characted for encoding data in reedit_data has changed
    from '%' to '!', so any old pre-built urls with reedit_data set won't work.
  
  * searches are now case insensitive
  
  * gedafed has changed
  
    -> replace gedafed and restart it
  
  * app_site and app_path are not anymore needed in the startup script
  
    -> remove app_site and app_path from the startup scripts
  
  * all the templates have a new variable: DATABASE_DESC containing the
    comment set on the database. You thus can take the original
    example/template/header.html and use it for your application.
