        News and upgrading information for Gedafe
        =========================================

(arrows indicate actions that you should make when upgrading)

1.0.6
-----
* 'action=export' instead of 'action=list' or 'action=listrep' returns
  a comma-separated-values listing of all rows of the table. You can use
  the EXPORT_URL variable in the templates to reference the correct
  URL.

1.0.5
-----

* The edit view now returns to the "Referer" if it is provided by the browser.
  This makes it possible to jump internally directly to an edit view (from
  the list view of another table for example)

1.0.1
-----

* The old pre-0.9.16 meta_tables and meta_fields structure is not anymore
  supported.

* New template: error.html used for unexpected internal errors.

  -> put the new error.html in your templates directories

* The escaping characted for encoding data in reedit_data has changed
  from '%' to '!', so any old pre-built urls with reedit_data set won't work.

* searches are now case insensitive

* gedafed has changed

  -> replace gedafed and restart it

* app_site and app_path are not anymore needed in the startup script

  -> remove app_site and app_path from the startup scripts

* all the templates have a new variable: DATABASE_DESC containing the comment set
  on the database. You thus can take the original example/template/header.html and
  use it for your application.
