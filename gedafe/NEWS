        News and upgrading information for Gedafe
        =========================================

(arrows indicate actions that you should make when upgrading)

1.2.0 (2003-07-FIXME)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Combo-boxes must always reference the 'id' of the table and not the
    'hid' if the table has one. The old behaviour was confusing and was
    thus changed, but you can still tell Gedafe to behave like that
    by setting 'gedafe_compat' to '1.0' in the Start function.

    -> Change all combo-boxes where the 'hid' is referenced in the
       'id' field of the view to reference the 'id' of the table

    OR

    -> Put the following in the Start function of the cgi script:

         gedafe_compat => '1.0'

  * More widgets: the 'widget' attribute of the meta_fields
    can now specify more widgets and widgets can now have parameters. For
    example with 'idcombo(combo=...)' another combo-box can be selected
    instead of the one chosen by Gedafe. See 'EDIT WIDGETS' in
    gedafe-sql.pod for a description of all widgets.

  * Blobs (files) can now be inserted into bytea columns if you have
    Postgresql >= 7.2

  * Referencing large tables can now be done trough a java
    applet instead of a html select widget. This makes large (>100 rows or
    a few kb) tables more easy to use. See documentation about 'isearch'
    for details.
    Please remember to set the 'isearch' value to point to your copy of
    isearch.jar in your cgi script. It must be a relative address on the 
    same server as the cgi script for java security reasons.

  * Dates can now be entered with a special 'date' widget.

  * Data can now be scanned for tokens resembling web objects (e.g.
    e-mail addresses, http urls), and automatically marked up to be hyper
    links. Set the 'markup' attribute to 1 in meta_fields for the desired
    column.
  
  * Gedafe can now count the total number of results returned from the
    database.  This is helpful for seeing the number of items found by a
    search, and in skipping to the beginning end or of a result set.
    When enabled, you will see extra navigation links "First", and "Last"
    on every page, as well as the index of the rows shown in relation to
    total rows.  To enable this feature, call Start() with the
      'show_row_count' => 1,
    parameter.  It is turned off by default due to slightly higher
    database overhead.
  
  * If you have the Text::CSV_XS Perl module installed (available from CPAN),
    gedafe automatically detects it, and gives the option of exporting data
    either in CSV format (comma-separated-values), or in tab-delimited format.
    CSV format is useful for data with embedded newlines characters.

  * The meta_fields attribute 'align' can be used to change the alignment
    of a coulumn. The default is right-aligned for numeric fields and
    left-aligned otherwise.

  * The buttons in the list view (with the arrows for navigation and 'ADD' to
    add a new record) can now also appear at the top before the list. Use the
    'list_buttons' option in the Start function to select where to display the
    buttons. The value can be one of: top, bottom, both or none.

1.0.6 (2002-03-17)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * 'action=export' instead of 'action=list' or 'action=listrep' returns
    a comma-separated-values listing of all rows of the table. You can use
    the EXPORT_URL variable in the templates to reference the correct
    URL.

1.0.5 (2002-02-18)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * The edit view now returns to the "Referer" if it is provided by the browser.
    This makes it possible to jump internally directly to an edit view (from
    the list view of another table for example)

1.0.1 (2001-02-20)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * The old pre-0.9.16 meta_tables and meta_fields structure is not anymore
    supported.
  
  * New template: error.html used for unexpected internal errors.
  
    -> put the new error.html in your templates directories
  
  * The escaping characted for encoding data in reedit_data has changed
    from '%' to '!', so any old pre-built urls with reedit_data set won't work.
  
  * searches are now case insensitive
  
  * gedafed has changed
  
    -> replace gedafed and restart it
  
  * app_site and app_path are not anymore needed in the startup script
  
    -> remove app_site and app_path from the startup scripts
  
  * all the templates have a new variable: DATABASE_DESC containing the
    comment set on the database. You thus can take the original
    example/template/header.html and use it for your application.
