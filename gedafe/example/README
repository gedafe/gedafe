Gedafe Examples
---------------

This directory contains an example application for Gedafe. It's a very simple
ordering system with products, customers and orders.

demo1.sql contains the PostgreSQL command to create the database.

demo1.cgi is the Gedafe startup script. You have to adjust the paths to where
you have installed Gedafe.

Example templates are also included (in the 'templates' directory). These
should be usable for any application.

The 'images' directory contains the images that are references in the example
templates. You should install them so that they can be accessed in '/images'
on the web server (if you want them in another place, you can easily change
the templates).
