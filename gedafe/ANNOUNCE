        ============================================
        Gedafe (the Generic Database Frontend) 1.0.0
        ============================================


Introduction
------------

    Gedafe (the Generic Datbase Frontend) is a web-based database
    frontend that is database-application independent. That means that
    the (perl) code doesn't contain any information about what tables
    are present in the database, how the data is organized or how the
    forms should be made.

    The idea is to put all the application logic in the database along
    with meta-information on how to present the data and then use a
    generic frontend that gathers that information and uses it to
    build the interface presented to the user. The developement time
    is greatly reduced, since you only have to develop the application
    at the database level.

    Gedafe does also use a flexible templating system, such that you
    can completely customize the look of the user interface and "deep
    linking" (i.e. you can bookmark any viewed page).

    At the moment Gedafe works only with PostgreSQL. Note that this is
    not a database-administration frontend, but a user-interface
    frontend.


Release Notes
-------------

    This is the first public version. The program has been used internally
    for three months without problems.
