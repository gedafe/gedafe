        ============================================
        Gedafe (the Generic Database Frontend) 1.0.1
        ============================================


Documentation
-------------

    Gedafe comes with two main documentation files:

    doc/gedafe-user.txt   explains how to install and use gedafe
    doc/gedafe-sql.txt    explains how to setup a gedafe app in postgresql
    doc/cpptemplate.txt   documentation for the templating system


Examples
--------

    See example/README.


Versioning Scheme
-----------------

    Gedafe uses a linux-style versioning, i.e. three number versions
    (major.minor.minorminor) and stable/unstable marked by the minor
    number being even (stable) or odd (unstable).

    The file UPGRADE contains upgrade instructions that you should
    carefully read before upgrading Gedafe (for minor version changes too).
